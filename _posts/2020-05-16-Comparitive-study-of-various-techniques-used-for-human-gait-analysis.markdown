In this project three different approaches are used to detect gait abnormalities for human motion. The objective of the project is to do a comparative study of gait analysis using Inertial sensors, Optical sensor(camera) and Convolution Neural Networks. Primarily, computer vision tools are used to obtain the gait parameters from a video and analyzed to obtain a gait score that provides a quantitive measure of a person's gait. Further, inertial measurement sensors are used to determine the accuracy of the data acquisition process using videos. Lastly, a Neural Network model is trained to classify between a normal and abnormal gait.
